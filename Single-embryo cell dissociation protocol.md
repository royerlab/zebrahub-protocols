To obtain high-quality data, we developed and optimized a single-embryo single-cell dissociation protocol that varies based on the 10 developmental stages we studied. We used a very gentle dissociation method for early stages, and a harsher method for later stages. Our protocol utilized a combination of chemical and mechanical methods to achieve the highest possible dissociation efficiency while also maximizing cell viability.

All steps should be performed under sterile conditions to prevent contamination. RNA isolation and library preparation should be performed following the manufacturer's instructions.

Materials:
- Zebrafish embryos
- 1mg/ml Pronase solution
- PBS + 2% BSA
- FACSmax solution (Gentalis - T200100)
- 0.25% Trypsin-collagenase (100 mg/ml) solution
- 1X PBS + 1% BSA solution
- 20 μm mesh
- 1X PBS+ 0.1% BSA + 18% optiprep solution
- Cellometer auto T4 cell counter (Nexcelom biosciences)
- Trypan blue solution

Procedure:
1. Dechorionate the zebrafish embryos using 1mg/ml Pronase solution.
2. Precoat 1.5 ml Eppendorfs with PBS + 2% BSA at room temperature for 15 minutes.
3. For earlier stages (10 hpf to 1 dpf), dissociate a single embryo in 50 ul of FACSmax solution. For later stages (2 dpf to 10 dpf), dissociate a single embryo in 50 ul of 0.25% Trypsin-collagenase solution.
4. Pipette and flick the Eppendorf gently to dissociate the embryo without forming bubbles. Centrifuge the Eppendorf between 300 rcf for 2 mins (earlier stages) to 750 rcf for 7 mins (later stages) at 4C depending on the stage of interest.
5. Carefully remove the dissociation media without dislocating the pellet. Wash the pellet with 1X PBS + 1% BSA solution.
6. Pass the solution through a 20 μm mesh for later stages (2dpf – 10 dpf) to remove undissociated debris. Centrifuge the solution again at 4C with the same conditions. Discard the supernatant and dissolve the pellet in 25 ul of 1X PBS+ 0.1% BSA + 18% optiprep.
7. Measure the cell concentration using the cellometer auto T4 cell counter. Dilute the cell suspension and trypan blue solution (1:4) to measure the cell count.
8. Repeat the above steps for each of the required stages, using a single embryo per experiment and 4 replicate experiments per stage (4 siblings).
