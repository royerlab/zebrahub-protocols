# Zebrafish embryo preparation for imaging in DaXi light-sheet microscope 

This protocol outlines the steps for preparing zebrafish embryos for imaging in a DaXi 
light-sheet microscope. The protocol involves dechorionation, embedding in low-gelling 
temperature agarose, positioning embryos for imaging, removing the agarose surrounding 
the tail, and setting up time-lapses with tricaine to prevent embryo movement.

## Materials:

- Glass-bottom cell culture dish (35mm Cell Culture Dish with Glass Bottom 20mm â€“ Stellar Scientific)
- Low-gelling temperature agarose (Sigma, A0701)
- Custom-made capillary
- Dissection knife
- Forceps
- Embryo-medium solution
- Tricaine (0.016%)

## Protocol:

1. Dechorionate embryos in a glass-bottom cell culture dish.
2. Gently transfer embryos into a 0.7% solution of low-gelling temperature agarose.
3. Position embryos at the correct position and angle for imaging using a custom-made capillary.
4. Once the agarose solidifies, use a dissection knife and forceps to remove the agarose surrounding the tail to permit full development and tail elongation.
5. Set up time lapses with a gentle flow of fresh and filtered embryo-medium solution with 0.016% tricaine to prevent embryo movement.
